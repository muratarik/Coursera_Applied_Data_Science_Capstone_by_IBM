Capstone Project Proposal

Problem Definition:

In this project we look at severity of the car accidents. Severity is grouped in two categories: 
1 prop damage and 2 injury. We believe that municipilities can use this prediction to improve roads and road signs. 
Drivers can be more cautious due to some specific conditions.

Datasets:

This data set is collected by SDOT Traffic Management Division, Traffic Records Group and includes all types of collisions.

Our target column is SEVERITYCODE. There are 38 columns including target column. Dataset has 194673 rows. 
Some features are ongitute, latititure, location, time, date, collision type, wheather, road condition, light condition...

First I will check missiing values. Then I will do explotary data analysis(EDA). After EDA i will check categorical variables and fit label encoder to preapare data set to machine learning process.

After data set is ready for ML process, I wll try different predictive models.

Choose the best predictive model and do parameter tuning for that model
