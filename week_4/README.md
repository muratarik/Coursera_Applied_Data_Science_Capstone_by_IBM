# Capstone Project

Problem definition:

Rhode Island is the smallest but the most crowded state in the USA. Ivy league Brown University is located at Providence.

RI is famous with its restaurants and touristic places.

We would like to open a coffee shop where students can hang out. It is important to consider location which should be closer to the universities.

We want to also look at other successful coffee shops locations so this will give us idea about good spots for business locations.

Datasets:

RI school name and locations are obtained from wiki webpage.

School's exact locations and coffe shop locations will be obtained from Foursquare
